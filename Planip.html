              <b>Project Description</b>
							<ul>
							<li>Planip is a trip planning app. It aims at providing users with the most efficient way to plan a trip. </li>
							<li>By cooperating with multiple third-party traveling apps and websites, Planip helps users to collect and sort information and thus create customized trip plans. Users can create a plan from scratch, or choose to generate a plan accordingly or get recommended trip plans. Furthermore, users can share plans with their friends, and everyone can plan their trips together at the same time. </li>
							<li>Planip is a group project in which I cooperated with Phyllis Fei; both of us play an equal role in user research, interaction design, and future visual design.</li></ul>
				      <b>Research</b><br>
							<ul>
								<li>Goals:
									<ul><li>Learn about common behaviors of individuals when go traveling, including relevant information gathering, preparation before travel, habits during and after a trip.</li>
									<li>Determine usersâ€™ needs and frustrations when planning for a trip.</li>
									<li>Identify areas of the planning experience that could be improved.</li></ul>
								</li>
								<li>Methods:
									<ul><li>Quantitative: conducted surveys among different age groups and received 243 valid
									responses.</li>
									<li>Qualitative: interviewed 5 people--three people who are students from various universities and two people who are already in work.</li></ul>
								</li>
								<li>Findings:
									<ul><li>Users need well-categorized traveling information for their reference.</li>
									<li>Users value efficiency over conciseness when planning for a trip.</li>
									<li>Users need apps to assist them in planning a trip with others.</li></ul>
								</li>
							</ul>

							<p><b>Ideation</b></p>
							<p>Based on previous user research, we decided to create three scenarios and thus provide three entrances accordingly.</p>
							<ul>
								<li>First is when users know how to plan the trip and choose to plan everything manually from scratch.</li>
								<li>Second is when users have a list of places they want to visit but want the app to generate the most efficient route for them.</li>
								<li>Third is when users want a direct recommended route based on their interests and traveling companions.</li>
							</ul>
							<p>Basic User Flow:</p>
